abstract="In this paper, we address the encoding into CNF clauses of Boolean cardinality constraints that arise in many practical applications. The proposed encoding is efficient with respect to unit propagation, which is implemented in almost all complete CNF satisfiability solvers. We prove the practical efficiency of this encoding on some problems arising in discrete tomography that involve many cardinality constraints. This encoding is also used together with a trivial variable elimination in order to re-encode parity learning benchmarks so that a simple Davis and Putnam procedure can solve them.",

pages="827--831",
abstract="We consider the problem of encoding Boolean cardinality constraints in conjunctive normal form (CNF). Boolean cardinality constraints are formulae expressing that at most (resp. at least) k out of n propositional variables are true. We give two novel encodings that improve upon existing results, one which requires only 7n clauses and 2n auxiliary variables, and another one demanding {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}O{\}}(n {\backslash}cdot k){\$}clauses, but with the advantage that inconsistencies can be detected in linear time by unit propagation alone. Moreover, we prove a linear lower bound on the number of required clauses for any such encoding.",
